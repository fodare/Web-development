		<h2>JavaScript Code Block</h2>
		<p>

			groupped together to perform a specific function. <br />
      They are collectively called JavaScript function. Example below: <br />
      <blockquote>
        function functionName(){

    <h2>JavaScript Containers</h2>
    <p>These are like Containers used to store / hold a value to be used later in the program. <br>

    var x = 10; // This means create a varible called x and store the vale 10 in the x.
  </p>
  <hr>S
  <h2>Diffrence between lets & const</h2>
  <p>In the older version it was possible to declare a variable with the var keyword but it was also possible <br>
    to declare variable with the keyword "lets" and "const". However, there is a diffrence between the lets and const. <br>
    lets allows one to create a variable that is a fixed / certain scope whereas const allows one to create a variable <br>
    that is a fixed value.
  </p>

  <h2>JavaScript variable</h2>
  <p>
    Variabdles are like containers that hold a vlaue. <br>
    Declaring a variable in JavaScript => var variableName ; // delclaring a variable <br>
    Assigning a value to a vairable => var variableName = "Damilare"; // Assigning a value to a decalred variable
  </p>
