                    I'm originally from India, so i try to take advantage of everything thay the Bay area has <br>
                    to offer. When i'm not making magic at my desk, you're likely to find me in the football <br>
                    pitch, nature or eating my way through Bombay and it's wonderful street food corners or taking <br>
                    a drive along the Bombay coast. My boyfriend really loves me.
